# WatchIt!

WatchIt! improve your health habits with wearable sensors.

<br />

With the vast amount of data produced by an Apple Watch daily, it is hard to identify which aspects of user’s health require their immediate attention, and what actions are necessary to improve their health. WatchIt! is designed to indicate the user’s health metrics that require improvement by comparing the user’s data to the medically established norms in their demographic group. Based on the outcome, the application also recommends local fitness classes that will help improve those metrics.

<br />
This application was built as a part of the Data Incubator Fellowship and serves as my Capstone Project. 

The web app is using an amazing template Swipe Bootstrap 5 by Themesberg.
